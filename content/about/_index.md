title: About
---

My name is Eliezer 'Eli' Encarnacion, and I'm a Software Engineer in Raleigh, North Carolina. My current work involves developing and maintaining highly available and scalable .NET RESTful web services for the [Citrix ShareFile product](https://www.sharefile.com/).

My everyday work involves a lot of backend development of C# (both .NET Framework and .net core) services and RESTful APIs, running on the AWS infrastructure. I occasionally do some database work with both Sql (Sql Server) and NoSql (DynamoDB) technologies.

I am passionate about Software Development and enjoy learning new technologies. I'm currently enjoying writing JavaScript ES6 code in both the front end (VueJS, React) and back end (Node/Express). I am also venturing into functional programming in F#. If you have any side project ideas I can implement with these technologies, please send them my way!

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and playing music to accompany my wife's beautiful singing. 

### A bit more about me

I was born and raised in [Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo), where I completed my high school education. My first exposition to programming was in high school, copying and pasting code to build a calculator in VB6 (not the greatest beginner's language). While I enjoyed that experience, I did not pursue programming beyond the classroom. My intention was to study to become a medical doctor, but a visit to the ER a few months before graduation made me realize the medical field wasn't for me.

My only other "passions" at the time were graphic design and video editing. However, a major in the graphic arts was only offered by a few select universities, none of which my family could afford. My father, a bit impatient with my lack of options, suggested that since I spent so much time on the computer, I should study Information Technology, which was a widely available program of study. I hesitated a bit, but decided it was better than nothing, so I enrolled in the program at the [Universidad Dominicana O&M](http://www.udoym.edu.do/).

I knew that a successful career in technology would require a proper understanding of programming, so I picked up my first (and still dear to my heart) programming book, [Beginning Python: from Novice to Professional](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-Novice-Professional-Experts/dp/1590599829). This book was my first real introduction to programming, and I immediately fell in love with it. I wrote many riddle and math puzzles in Python as console apps, and shared them with friends for our entertainment.

A year into my Information Technology program, I left the D.R to join my father in Miami, FL. There, I enrolled in [Miami Dade College's](http://www.mdc.edu/) to complete an Associate's degree in Computer Science. Upon graduation, I transferred to the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://cs.unc.edu/), where I completed the Bachelor's degree in CS. I've been living in the Triangle area in North Carolina since, though my wife and I are planning to return to South Florida.
